INSTRUCTIONS
============

If you start the game, you will see that it just loads a map and place
some units on it. You are asked to implement the unit attack:

* The player should be able to select the units, and then select a
building to make the units attack it.

* The buildings should have hit points, and they should decrease as
they are being attacked by the units.

* The game should end when all the buildings have been destroyed

On top of that, if you want something more, you can also make any of these:

* Implement pathfinding
Make the units find a path without going through other entities

* Implement a game HUD
You can implement a scoreboard, a unit stats panel, a bottom panel to allow
the user to deploy units by dragging them, etc...

* Implement the defense
Make the turrets shoot at their attackers

* Implement a proyectile system
Make the units shoot proyectiles to the city buildings

*Implement attack particles
Damage indicators, explosions, ...

* Implement an AI
Make the units to attack by themselves

* Surprise us!
Of course, you can also do whatever it crosses your mind :)
